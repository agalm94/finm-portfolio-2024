This conclusion is supported by the idea of time-diversification, which was explored in the Barnstable case. Time-diversification suggests that investors are rewarded with better risk-adjusted returns when they hold assets for a longer period of time. Intuitively, this is supported by the logic that investors take on more risk of loss over a longer period of time. Mathematically, this is supported by the fact that mean excess returns scale linearly with time while excess return volatility scale sub-linearly through time. Consequently, the sharpe ratio is bound to increase at a rate of $\\sqrt{t}$ where t represents the number of periods the portfolio is held.\n",
